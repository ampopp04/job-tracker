# System Framework Example - Basic Project Management

This project demonstrates enterprise level application development using the rapid release Java Enterprise System Framework. 

This sample shows a basic Project Management application and how you can easily create DTO objects and the framework does the rest! It also dynamically generates your UI through migrations.

Although the framework does almost everything for you, the entire project is entirely customizable using standard spring and java practices.
